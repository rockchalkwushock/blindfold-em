Blindfold'em is a productivity management web-application.

## About

This was an idea I had back in March of 2017 when I began to change a lot about
who I am and how I do things. The two major contributing factors to this project
are Mel Robbins
[The 5 Second Rule](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Rule-Transform-Confidence-Everyday/dp/1682612384/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510691845&sr=8-1&keywords=mel+robbins)
and some bars from Ces Cru's song
[Recession Proof](https://open.spotify.com/user/deimos92/playlist/5xh6CHdYs6QTkQ2TxPk0Xs):

> _"I blindfolded my goals, now line'em up and execute."_

I soon began planning out my mornings with things called _Blindfold Sessions_ in
which I had to state what the goal was I wanted to achieve in _x_ amount of time
and would set out to execute it...in a very NWA _"Gangsta Gangsta"_ manner
:joy:. Back then I would just grab my iPhone and tell Siri to set a timer for
_x_ about of time and record things in my journal (like the real thing not
online). I thought to myself it would be awesome to have an application in which
I could set a timer and a cooldown period, declare what my goal was for that
time, and upon completion of the timer be prompted to state if I executed or not
and why. Taking the project a step further would be to integrate with
third-party API's like [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) and create a dashboard
for the user to see and track their progress in executing what they have set out
to accomplish.

The plan would be to turn this into an Electron application, but that will be
down the road for now a simple web application that is nothing more than a
Pomodoro will be what makes up Blindfold'em 1.0.0.
